# SilenceRemove

Silence removal GUI based on an improved version of [this tool](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28826-silence-removal-in-speech-signals?focused=c9fdfa40-65ab-e9fe-13b9-d9d3efb80fa8&tab=function)

The GUI is implemented with online learning to adjust the start and end points using a sort of gradient descent based on the user correction of the automatic noise removal.

More explanation to be added later...
